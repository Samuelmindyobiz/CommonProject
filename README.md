# CommonProject


A common project can be a project created by us but turns out it's actually also a brand. See this link: http://www.commonprojects.com/ (Contributed by Marla)

Write about the nature

-Nature is all the naturally occurring things on this planet. Nature is the animals, plants, events, processes, and products of the earth that are not made by people. It is the physical world and everything that lives in it. “Nature” is more than just a word for plants, animals, and habitats.
